# 💡 Minimalistic Help Center hosted on GitHub Pages

This is a minimalistic responsive Help Center hosted on GitHub pages written in vanilla JS. It does not need the maintenance of any servers or databases and can be hosted entirely on ❤️ GitHub for free!

Includes a very few dependencies:

-   [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for better fuzzy search
-   [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) to convert
    markdown to HTML
-   Beatiful font [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter)

Feel free to customize by visual identity of your preference .)
To update `<head>` of your Help Center is recommended to follow [HEAD - A list of everything that _could_ go in the head of your document ](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD)

Inspired by [Githu Pages URL shortener](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener/).

## 💪 Motivation

Well, I want to convince my teammates that 99% of all problems are possible to solve via GIT (or GitHub)

Also we wanted to launch some simple FAQ but the most 3rd party tools are just limiting and cost us $$$. So, why not?
